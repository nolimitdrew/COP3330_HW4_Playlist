# COP3330_HW4_Playlist
You will be writing classes that implement a simulation of a playlist for a digital music device.  The list will be a dynamic array of Song objects, each of which stores several pieces of information about a song.  You will need to finish the writing of two classes:  Song and Playlist.  The full header file for the Song class has been provided in a file called song.h.
